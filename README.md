# Gale-Shapley-algorithm-for-stable-matching

The main part of the project was to implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching with an O(n2) running time.
In our version, people will be adopting pets. Each person will adopt exactly one pet and each pet will be adopted by exactly one person. 
Both people and pets have preference lists that you will read from a file. The file will be formatted as follows:

Line 1: Number of people/pets (n)
Lines 2 to n+1: Names of people
Lines n+2 to 2n+1: Preference lists of people using indices, not names (n preferences per line)
Lines 2n+2 to 3n+1: Names of pets
Lines 3n+2 to 4n+1: Preference lists of pets using indices, not name (n preferences per line)
